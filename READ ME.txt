#A column-switching two-dimensional liquid chromatography - high resolution/triple quadrupole dual mass spectrometry system for simultaneously untargeted metabolome and targeted exposome analyses

## Abstract
Metabolome-exposome association studies (mEWAS) demands high-coverage and high-sensitivity analytical methods for metabolites and exposures with diverse chemical properties and concentrations. Here, we present an integrated column-switching two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) - high resolution/triple quadrupole dual mass spectrometry (MS) method, achieving simultaneously untargeted metabolome and targeted exposome analyses including 598 chemical exposures in a single run. Polar and non-polar compounds with log P ranging from -8 to 15 were separated without unretained compounds in the dead time. Benchmarked against biological matrices, analyte coverage increased by 35-104% over one-dimensional LC method. Highly sensitive limits of detection with 0.001-1 μg/mL for >90% metabolites and 0.001-1 ng/mL for >90% chemical exposures were obtained, matching the concentration difference between the metabolome and exposome in human blood. The method was demonstrated in patients with chronic diseases, showing the feasibility of establishing simultaneously untargeted metabolome and targeted exposome analytical methods for mEWAS by integrating 2DLC-dual MS techniques.
